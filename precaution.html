  <div class="cont">Flood Precautions
          In any flooding or potential flooding event, the following actions should be taken:
          <h3>Protecting your home</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding</li>
              <li>Install check valves in sewer traps to prevent floodwater from backing up into your home.</li>
              <li>Seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds to avoid seepage.</li>
              <li>Keep an adequate supply of food, candles and drinking water in case you are trapped inside your home.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>When a flood is imminent</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Listen to designated radio/TV emergency alert systems for emergency instructions.</li>
              <li>Secure/bring in outdoor furniture or other items that might float away and become a potential hazard.</li>
              <li>Move valuable items and papers/documents to upper floors.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>During a flood</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Seek higher ground. Do not wait for instructions.</li>
              <li>Be aware of flash flood areas such as canals, streams, drainage channels.</li>
              <li>If instructed, turn off utilities at main switches and unplug appliances - do not touch electrical equipment if wet.</li>
              <li>If you must leave your home, do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet. Use a stick to test depth.</li>
              <li>Do not try to drive over a flooded road. If your car stalls, abandon it immediately and seek an alternate route.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>After a flood</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Stay away from flood water - do not attempt to swim, walk or drive through the area</li>
              <li>Be aware of areas where water has receded. Roadways may have weakened and could collapse.</li>
              <li>Avoid downed power lines and muddy waters where power lines may have fallen.</li>
              <li>Do not drink tap water until advised by the Health Unit that the water is safe to drink.</li>

      <h2>TSUNAMI<hr width=40></h2>
      <div class="cont">
        <h3>Top Tips<h3>
          <ul class="ulcont">
            <li>To escape a tsunami, go as high and as far as you can – ideally to a spot 100 feet above sea level or 2 miles away.</li>
            <li>Every foot inland or upward may make a difference!</li>
            <li>If you can see the wave, you are too close for safety.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>If You Feel a Strong Coastal Earthquake</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Drop, cover, and hold on to protect yourself from the earthquake.</li>
            <li>When the shaking stops, gather members of your household and review your evacuation plan. A tsunami may be coming within minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a NOAA Weather Radio or stay tuned to a Coast Guard emergency frequency station, or a local radio or television station for updated emergency information.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions issued by local authorities. Recommended evacuation routes may be different from the one you planned, or you may be advised to climb higher.</li>
            <li>If you hear an official tsunami warning or detect signs of a tsunami, evacuate at once. A tsunami warning is issued when authorities are certain that a tsunami threat exists, and there may be little time to get out.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Staying Safe After a Tsunami</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Let friends and family know you’re safe.</li>
            <li>If evacuated, return only when authorities say it is safe to do so.</li>
            <li> Continue listening to local news or a NOAA Weather Radio for updated information and instructions.</li>
            <li>If people around you are injured, practice CHECK, CALL, CARE. Check the scene to be sure it’s safe for you to approach, call for help, and if you are trained, provide first aid to those in need until emergency responders can arrive.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>TERRORISM<hr width=40></h2>
        <div class="cont">
          While no plan is foolproof, these precautions may provide some degree of protection and can serve as practical and psychological deterrents to would-be terrorists. When traveling by air:
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid adding distinctive markings to your luggage, even though this is a recommended way to discourage luggage theft. Bright markings on your luggage make you more visible and mark you as a tourist at a time when it's better to avoid being noticed.</li>
            <li>After checking in for your flight, go immediately to the secured areas of the airport.</li>
            <li>When you arrive at a destination, get your baggage and leave the airport as quickly as possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3> General rules for personal security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If possible, travel with others. There is more safety in numbers.</li>
              <li>Avoid places that are popular with Western travelers, who are obvious targets for terrorism. Everywhere you go, have a plan, so you can act automatically in case of a bomb or terrorist attack.</li>
              <li>Memorize the locations and phone numbers of possible safe places to go, such as hospitals, hotels, and police stations.</li>
              <li>Be careful with strangers--any stranger, for example, even taxi drivers.</li>
              <li>Don't tell a stranger too many details about your life or your plans. </li>
              <li>When in conversation with someone you do trust, be aware of people around you who may be listening.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security inside your hotel</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If someone knocks at your hotel room door, never open it if you don't know who it is and can verify their identity. </li>
              <li>Arrange meetings with strangers in the public areas of your hotel, never in your room.  </li>
              <li>If a package is delivered that you were not expecting, refuse it. </li>
              <li>Before driving, check your car to make sure it is in good condition and that nothing looks obviously changed. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>If an attack does occur</h3>
            <p>Lie flat on the floor and behind any solid object that might protect you from gunfire. Stay put until the danger passes. If you have to move, do it on your stomach. When it's safe to get up, don’t stop for any reason, even to help police or rescue personnel. Just leave the area right away. </p>

          <h2>LACK OF WATER<hr width=40></h2>
          <div class="cont">
            <h3>Be prepared</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep bottles of drinking water on hand at home. You should have reserves for at least three days, accounting for two litres of water per person per day for drinking alone. You should also have an additional two litres per person per day for food preparation and personal hygiene, such as brushing one’s teeth. Your pets will need water too.</li>
              <li>Make sure to have a collection of containers (empty water bottles, pitchers, large pots, etc.) that can hold drinking water distributed by your municipality in bulk rather than in bottles. These containers should be new, in order to preserve the microbiological quality of the distributed water. If not, they should be clean and in good condition, and should not have stored food or contained chemical products (e.g. detergents).</li>
              <li>Finally, have large-capacity containers on hand to collect non-potable water, which is useful for purposes like flushing toilets</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Follow the authorities’ instructions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If there is a problem regarding water quality or availability, the authorities will provide instructions. Follow them carefully. If your municipality organizes a drinking water distribution initiative or encourages you to get your water in a place that is not affected by the problem, consult it for instructions regarding how the water is to be distributed and used.</li>
              <li>Even if you are not affected by a water quality or availability issue in your municipality, you might receive an advisory regarding water use restrictions. For example, a notice may prohibit watering lawns, trees or flowers, filling swimming pools or washing vehicles for a specified period. Regardless of the restriction in question, you must strictly observe the instructions provided to prevent a possible water shortage or ensure the situation returns to normal as soon as possible for everyone in your municipality.Top of page</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Know what to do in the event of drinking water contamination</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In the event of drinking water contamination, follow boiling or drinking water avoidance advisories issued by the heads of drinking water distribution networks. Even clear, odorless and tasteless, water can pose a health risk.</li>
              <li>Use the reserves of bottled water you have on hand, such as in your emergency kit. Purchase a reasonable quantity of bottled water, but don’t empty the supermarket shelves: other people will need that water too.</li>

              <h3>What to Do in Case of a Fire</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Immediately pull the nearest fire alarm pull station as you exit the building.</li>
                <li>When evacuating the building, be sure to feel doors for heat before opening them to be sure there is no fire danger on the other side.</li>
                <li>If there is smoke in the air, stay low to the ground, especially your head, to reduce inhalation exposure. Keep on hand on the wall to prevent disorientation and crawl to the nearest exit.</li>
                <li>Once away and clear from danger, call your report contact and inform them of the fire.</li>
                <li>Go to your refuge area and await further instructions from emergency personnel.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Fire Safety Precautions and Fire Systems Equipment</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Never store flammable materials in your room or apartment.</li>
                <li>Do not tamper with any fire system equipment such as smoke detectors, pull stations or fire extinguishers. Doing so is a criminal offense.</li>

            <div class="cont">
              Here is the order of the most common causes of accidents among our customers. Being aware of these situations will significantly reduce your risk.
              <ul>
                <li>Accidents in a parking lot!The 6th most common accident is a rollover on a curve. 7th is the collision on a narrow alley. 8th is hitting a cyclist when turning right. These are just some examples of a large number and variety of accidents. Many accidents happen in a parking lot, where numerous cars, people, and pillars compete for the limited space. Also, parking lots are often small with limited lighting</li>
                <li>Rear-Ending! A car cannot stop immediately. If you hit the brake at 40km/h, the car travels 10m before stopping. Slippery roads or bad weather can extend this up to 110m! Your driving experience in your home country will not necessary be reflected here.  </li>
                <li>Be careful with the door! A small error and a minor damage can waste your precious vacation time!Calling the police, on-site investigation, negotiation, and paperwork.</li>
                <li>Ignoring the stop sign! Don't miss the stop line at an intersection.Some drivers ignore this and continue forward.This can cause a major accident or injury</li>
                <li>Overlooking the traffic signal! Inside the city, traffic signals are often confusing. You may not know which of the multiple signals you need to follow. Running a red light or failing to check the traffic signal can lead to a major accident. </li>
              </ul>
